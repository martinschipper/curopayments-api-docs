# Transactions

This section provides reference information about payment transactions.  

 Every payment request in the API will generate a new Transaction.  
 Each Transaction is uniquely identified by a CURO Transaction ID (transaction_id): `TYYM12345678`.  

 > 
`T` from "Transaction".  
`YY` year number.
`M` month as hexadecimal (1-9, A=10, B=11, C=12).  
`12345678` 8 digit unique number.  
The total length is always 12 characters

You are required to provide a Transaction Reference (reference) to indentify this transaction in your own system.

Please see Transaction Flow for a schematic overview of the standard transaction processing.

Transactions can have several status codes during its lifetime, the complete list of Status Codes is shown below.
A Transaction is considered to be “Completed” (final) if the status code is in the 2XX range (200 or 210 mostly).

It is technically possible to create multiple transactions for the same Transaction Reference (reference). Please make sure your system can handle this correctly, for example by ignoring multiple notifications for the same reference if the transaction has already been completed (i.e. a 2XX code has been received).
