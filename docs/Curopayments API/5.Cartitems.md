# 5.Cartitems

### CartItems

CURO will accept cartitems for every payment request, however the cartitems are required for some payment methods like Klarna and Afterpay.

>When cartitems are required for the chosen payment method, the sum of all the cartitems must be the same as the transaction amount provided!
