# Return URL


When the transaction has been processed, the consumer will be redirected to the url_success, url_failure, url_pending or url_cancel depending on the transaction status and the provided URL's for the transaction.
You can dynamically add any required arguments to continue the consumer session on you webshop when you submit the transaction data to the gateway.

The given URL will automatically receive additional (GET) parameters indicating the current status of the transaction.
